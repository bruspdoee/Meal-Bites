      <p>mealbites is a charitable organization aimed at utilizing valuable wasted resources to solve hunger in the United States.</p>
      <p>We began operating in Florida when we noticed fruit from local trees going unharvested. We started an outreach program to collect mangoes, bananas, and lychees from neighbors and drop them off at local food banks. When collecting the fruit, we were often asked if we could take canned goods and other miscellaneous household goods as well.</p>
      <p>At this point we realized the need for a service that provides a connection between donors and charitable organizations in need of produce.</p>
      <p>We look to our community as volunteers to provide transportation of goods to the food banks. Individual donors and vendors will be able to list items they have readily available and direct them to the charitable organization in need.</p>
      <p>This is a tremendous opportunity to provide both a solution to the tremendous amount of waste and hunger in this country.</p>
